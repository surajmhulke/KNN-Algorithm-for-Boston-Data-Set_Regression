## Introduction
This project utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to perform regression on the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes based on various features.

## Importing Libraries
In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries and modules, including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib, for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Importing Dataset
We load the Boston Housing dataset using scikit-learn's dataset module and create a pandas DataFrame to explore the data. The dataset contains information about various housing-related features, such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA section, we perform data exploration, including:
- Data summary and statistics
- Data visualization to understand relationships between variables
- Handling missing values and outliers

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves selecting relevant features, preprocessing data, and creating feature matrices for the
model. We may also apply scaling or normalization as necessary for KNN.

## Model Development and Evaluation
We implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to create a regression model. Steps include:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Model training on the training set
- Model evaluation using various regression metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared)

## Conclusion
"Our model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, making it a valuable asset for solving
regression problems in the context of the Boston Housing Dataset."
